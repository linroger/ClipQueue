    "prompt": "familiarize yourself with the codebase by reading through the swift files recursively in this codebase. use beads to\n    create new issues and to keep track of progress and update your progress. use the apple docs mcp, cupertino mcp, and\n    example apple sample code in /Users/rogerlin/SwiftDB for inspiration and guidance on how Apple software engineers\n    approach the design and building of macos apps. Here are your tasks. work through them methodically, taking the time\n  to\n    understand the issue, where it is in the codebase, diagnose the problem, figure out a solution, plan, and then execute\n    systematically and with close attention to detail. Option in settings menu to add new line after paste with enter, or\n    shift + enter\n\n    Option to automatically resize the height of the clip queue view depending on the number of items in the queue, so\n  that\n    if there are fewer items in the queue, the height of the clip queue view should be smaller, but the size of each item\n    remains the same.\n\n    Custom menubar icon not displaying correctly. It still shows the default menubar icon\n\n    Option to select multiple items from the clipboard queue with either command click or or shift click. Once the items\n  are\n    selected, pressing delete with remove the selected items, pressing enter will paste the items in the order they were\n    selected, with a line break after each item. Likewise, pressingg control w on a bunch of selected items will paste\n  them\n    sequentially in the order they were selected, in the previous app\u2019s selected textfield. Pressing enter or control w on\n  a\n    single selected item will paste it in the previous app\u2019s selected textfield. Pressing space on a single selected item\n  it\n    cause a quick view preview of the item, or a popup view to appear. Add a context menu option for Add to Favorites, and\n    add the Favorites tab to the segmented picker at the top which currently has Queue, History. Add a gold star to the\n  item\n    that is favorited. Also, add a Recents to a segmented picker added to the bottom, and also move the History tab to the\n    segmented picker, so that there should be a segmented picker on the top left of the app, with Queue and Favorites, and\n    another segmented picker to the bottom center, with History and Recents. Of course, add the options to toggle/hide the\n    History, Favorites, and Recents tabs, in which case if there are only 3, including Queue, just show a three tab\n    segmented picker on the top. Only if there are 4, including Queue, should you show two segmented pickers, one on the\n    top, and one on the bottom. Add a keyboard shortcut for navigating between the different tabs of the segmented\n  pickers,\n    and an option in the settings to return to the Queue tab after hiding and showing the clip queue, or to memorize the\n    previous tab that was open and persist it even after hiding and revealing the clip queue. Remove the \u201cView\u201c text from\n    the left of the segmented picker. Also, dragging and dropping items from the segmented picker to another app\u2019s\n  textfield\n    should paste the contents of that item into the textfield it is dropped on. Also, the app doesnt let you change the\n    keyboard shortcuts. Make it so that any combination of keys is allowed for a keyboard shortcut, such as left shift +\n    left tab. It shouldnt require a modifier key to be a keyboard shortcut. ultrathink. use the swiftui agents and skills\n    and any other resources at your disposal."

The context window should be a dropdown menu that appears when the user clicks on the menubar icon. The dropdown menu should contain the following options: \u201cShow Window\u201d, \u201cHide Window\u201d, \u201cMinimize Window\u201d, \u201cMaximize Window\u201d, \u201cClose Window\u201d, \u201cAbout\u201d, \u201cPreferences\u201d, \u201cQuit\u201d. \n\nMake sure every customization option in the settings menu is working properly, and not just there for show but doesn\u2019t actually do anything.\n\nMake app appear and hide on clicking on the dock icon, as well as on clicking on the menubar icon. This should be implemented in a way that is both efficient and user-friendly, ensuring that the window appears and hides smoothly and without any lag or delay. \n\nAllow users to map shortcuts to any keys they want, without requiring modifier keys\n\nAuto adjusting the window height based on the number of items isn\u2019t working properly. I want it to adjust the window height so that if there is only 1 item that is copied on the queue, the window height should be just enough to show that one item, without clipping it with the top and bottom bars, or making the window too tall. If an item is added to the queue, the window height should automatically adjust to show the newly added item as well. When an item is removed from the queue, the window height should automatically adjust to show the remaining items in the queue. This auto-adjusting feature should work smoothly and without any lag or delay. I want to make sure that the window height is always appropriate for the number of items in the queue, and that the window does not become too tall or too short as items are added or removed from the queue. The auto-adjusting window height feature should be implemented in a way that is both efficient and user-friendly, ensuring that the window height adapts seamlessly to the changing number of items in the queue. . be meticulous and don't make any mistakes. this is the last leg. don't let the app fuck up now. ultrathink."
